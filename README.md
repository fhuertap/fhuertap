# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Fer and you can call me Fer, I'm noobie on this but I'm not affraid. ðŸ¤–

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on C# and T-Sql devs
 ðŸŒ± And actually Iâ€™m currently learning C# and T-Sql (toast: xD)
 âš¡ Fun fact: I think this README.md in our profiles looks good and I even took a course to make it appears on mine. By the way, Is completely necessary to write the # sign? :)

### Oh, I'm sorry, I saw why I need to write the # sign. :D


## Greetings, Fer. ðŸ‘½
